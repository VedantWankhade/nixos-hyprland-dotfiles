# My humble NixOS + Hyprland setup.
> [!WARNING]
> Please do not run the `dots.sh` script. It is written according to my system, to set it up. Will probably not work for you and may end up deleting your config files. Please just steal the files from the `.config` directory and copy to yours.
## TODO
* ~~Fix `dots.sh` - if symlinked dirs exist for _~/.local/share/wallpapers_ or _~/.icons_, the script deletes the dirs from the project itself as they point recursively~~ (fixed temporarily with stow --no-folding)
* Make neovim config work with sudo
* ~~Tmux config~~
* ~~Application themes~~
* ~~Waybar redesign~~
* ~~Fix adding ssh identity on each reboot (NixOS sshAgent config related)~~
